# Escrow-Smart-contract

eCommerce has become a part and parcel of the modern age. With this ever-growing need of transferring money, it has become difficult for transacting parties to trust each other. This is a fundamental problem for electronic commerce where the buying and selling of goods take place between individuals that may not know or trust each other. Hence there is an uncertainty on every transaction in e-commerce. A buyer doesn’t want to pay without assurance that the seller will ship the purchased goods, while a seller doesn’t want to ship without assurance that payment will be received. Because the exchange of goods and payment cannot happen simultaneously, there is an inherent tension and need for trust in the trade — the seller must trust that the buyer will pay and the buyer must trust that the seller must deliver.

Escrow is a financial instrument held by a third party on behalf of two other parties who are completing a transaction. It helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account which is only released when all of the terms of an agreement are met Escrow service using blockchain can successfully solve the buyer-seller dilemma by being the trusted third party that holds the funds securely while the other party delivers its end of the deal. With the intervention of Escrow systems, the seller is sure that he/she gets paid once the goods or services are delivered while the buyer is sure of getting the goods before the funds are released to the seller.
